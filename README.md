## About <a name = "about"></a>

Color Scheme Gernator is a frontend project involving the [COLOR API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/docs#schemes)

The main goal of this project is to involve myself with Restfull Api's, We can GET request from Api by providing the usefull information like `https://www.thecolorapi.com/scheme?hex=${myColor}&mode=${myModeValue}&count=5`. Api can recived request and send us back response in the form of JSON. by using fetch APi we can retrived useful information and use it in front end project.

In the above url we have provided Color, mode, and count to the api and in result we can get many information and usually a color schem in different 5 arrays with all of the colors.
